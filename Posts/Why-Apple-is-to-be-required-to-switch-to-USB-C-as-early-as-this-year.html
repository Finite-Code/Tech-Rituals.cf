  Apple to be required to switch to USB-C as early as this year
  According to insider information, the European Commission intends to decide on the approval of a single charging connector for tablets, smartphones,
  laptops and other consumer electronics.
  Reportedly, the decision has drawn sharp criticism from Apple representatives.
  Recall that iPhone users have long complained about the use of the charging connector, while all Android-phones and even Apple's top 
  tablets and laptops have long switched to the USB-C connector.
  To recap, all current iPhones use the Lightning connector.
