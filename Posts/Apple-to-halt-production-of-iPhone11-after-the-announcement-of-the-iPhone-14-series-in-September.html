  <p class="text-left pt-5">
  Apple is about to halt the production of iPhone 11, after the announcement of iPhone 14 series in September. 
    This new device will be coming out with an incremental upgrade that doesn't justify the company not pushing through with their latest phone.
<br>
<br>
This is a sign of a world-changing event that everyone should be expecting. 
    These days Apple has been using their announcements for marketing purposes to appeal to newer customers, 
    even if it means running out of stock on older devices such as the iPhone 11. 
    For many companies this would be devastating but thankfully Apple's established in enough worldwide markets so they can afford to do this right now and still remain competitive in all aspects. 
    Apple has not yet made a final decision, largely dependent on the success of the new iPhone SE. 
    The Cupertinians wouldn't expect sales of the iPhone SE 2022 to suffer because of the older model. 
    And all because, demand for the iPhone 11 skyrocketed after the launch of the iPhone SE. 
    People would rather spend $70 more for a more attractive phone with two cameras and a reasonably fast platform instead of getting an SE just for 5G.
<br>
<br>
- The iPhone 12 won't be discontinued. What's more, its price will drop by $100 after the release of the iPhone 14.  
<br>
<br>
"The iPhone 13 is also going to remain on sale."
 <br>
 <br>
    This means that, in addition to the new flagship and the midrange Plus, Apple will be selling the iPhone 13.
